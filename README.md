Car-rental is a car rental platform, supplier-oriented, with a backend for managing car fleets and bookings, as well as a frontend for renting cars.                  
 Car-rental is designed to work with multiple suppliers. Each supplier can manage his car fleet and bookings from the backend. BookCars can also work with only one supplier and can be used as a car rental aggregator.
 From the backend, admins can create and manage suppliers, cars, locations, customers and bookings.
 When new suppliers are created, they receive an email prompting them to create an account in order to access the backend and manage their car fleet and bookings.
